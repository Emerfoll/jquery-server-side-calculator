# Project Name

Server-side Calculator

## Description

This is a project to build a user interface that communicates with a server to run calculations based on the user input.

The user inputs 2 numbers and selects an operator. When the submit button is pressed, it sends the selected operator along with the numbers input over to the server. The server then runs the selected calculation based on the operator sent, updates the answer to the calculation, then stores the calculation into the history with the other past calculations. The information is then sent back to the client side and updates the DOM with the answer.
